2.In which event of page cycle is the ViewState available?
After the Init() and before the Page_Load().

3.What is the difference between Server.Transfer and Response.Redirect?
In Server.Transfer page processing transfers from one page to the other page without making a round-trip back to the client's browser. This provides a faster response with a little less overhead on the server. The clients url history list or current url Server does not update in case of Server.Transfer.

Response.Redirect is used to redirect the user's browser to another page or site. It performs trip back to the client where the client's browser is redirected to the new page. The user's browser history list is updated to reflect the new address.

6. Where the viewstate is stored after the page postback?
